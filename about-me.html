					<h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

					<p>

						<span class="bold">I used to be a pack rat.</span> I had so many things that I thought that I
						loved, but the truth was I
						couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
					</p>
					<p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I
						couldn't hold a relationship.

					<h3>How I turned things around</h3>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span> I
						literally put 90% of my
						possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
						It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else
						to do. And it worked.
					</p>

					<h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
					<p>

						Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and
						work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.

						With how much it turned my life around, <span class="bold">I felt like I had no choice but to
							start sharing how I
							did it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I
						started
						this site!</p>
